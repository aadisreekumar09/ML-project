# ML-project
Machine learning project 

Developed a supervised machine learning model for classifying fitness activities based on activity and user data. The project included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model development using Python. The performance of the model was measured using standard classification metrics. The project helped gain experience in working with end-to-end machine learning and applying concepts of classification.
